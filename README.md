# bibki
### A pet project hosted on https://bibki.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
Bibki is a search website based on Google's design. Its primary purpose is to have fun. Apart from that, a user could use bibki to find any student from my school by the first/middle/last/short name, class number, or combination thereof. The website shows a link to one's account in the local social network VK, as well as his/her profile picture and the program and university, where this person studies at the moment. All this information was mined by my own scripts and website crawlers from public sources and stored in a heroku database. The project was meant for training and practice in development, so it wasn't widely advertised and used, and i didn't put too much effort in design.<br/>
## Technologies used:
Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Heroku, requests, BeautifulSoup4, bootstrap. <br/>
The code of web crawlers is not included in the repository, as it may contain sensitive data.
